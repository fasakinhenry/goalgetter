## Inspiration
Goal get was borne out of the need to keep our lives aligned and to live a fulfilling life. Often times I face the frustration of not being able to plan and achieve my goals due to the fact that I have no mentor or helper that checkmates my thought process or is more knowledgeable than me. Truth be told. AI has more access to knowledge than most humans do and this gives it more edge in making important decisions since it can learn and that AI feature is being explored in goalget and leveraging partyrock facilities made this dream a success.

Apart from the fact that I could not achieve my set goals, I became susceptible to distractions which I realized stems from the fact that I have no schedules orr routines. The moment I started taking routines seriously and leveraging atomic habits which led to great changes was when I became productive and effective in my everday life.

I also tested this on people close to me by making sure they plan each of their goals and generate a routine and it turned out to be a great benefit for them. They all kept to it but the lack of a mentor or an aid that makes planning effective was lacking so the Idea about an AI taking charge of that hassle became eminent.

## What it does

The AI helps you achieve your set goals by giving you steps and suggestions to achiev your goal, giving you resources, giving you routines to achieve a goal.

The AI can also serve as a teacher and mentor who tells you how to do things. The AI also provides routine and the timeframe for which the routine lasts and the long term effect of every routine. That seems like seeing the future of your actionsðŸ˜±ðŸ˜Ž

All in All, Goalget is a companion, teacher, friend and mentor that helps you achive your goals with defined routines and steps to follow.

## How we built it

Goalget was built using partyrock AWS web app that allows me to create an app by using prompts.

I also created some widgets that increased the efficiency of the app.

## Challenges we ran into

There was no real challenge. This app was my first encounter with AWS partyrock and it was almost seamless.

I only had issues with trying to locate items. I also didn't like the fact that we can use it to create mobile apps with different and unique UI.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Adding routines
- Adding widgets that makes routine generation easy
- Getting the best idea 

## What we learned

Partyrock AWS is a seamless app. I really learnt how easy it is to create an app with partyrock.

## What's next for Goalget

Adding other features like streek tracker amongst others
